Initialize a new project:

Open your terminal and run the following commands to create a new Vite project with React template:

bash
Copy code
npx create-vite my-react-app --template react
This will create a new folder named my-react-app with a basic React project structure.

Navigate to the project folder:

bash
Copy code
cd my-react-app
Start the development server:

Run the following command to start the Vite development server:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev
This command will start the development server, and you can access your app in your browser at http://localhost:3000.

Edit the React component:

Open the src/App.js file in your code editor and replace its contents with the following code:

jsx
Copy code
import React from 'react';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
View your app:

Go to http://localhost:3000 in your web browser, and you should see your "Hello, World!" message displayed on the page.

That's it! You've created a simple "Hello World" React app using Vite and React.js. You can now start building more complex applications by adding components, state management, and other features as needed.
